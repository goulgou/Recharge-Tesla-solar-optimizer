  name: Tesla Solar Optimizer (MQTT)
  description: >
    ### Overview

    The purpose of this automation is to optimize the charging process of a Tesla vehicle according to the chosen charge plan. By adjusting the charge limit, it helps maximize solar power consumption and efficiency while meeting the user's charging requirements.

    ### Requirements

    1. [solar_optimizer](https://github.com/jmcollin78/solar_optimizer) integration.
    2. [tesla_ble_mqtt_docker](https://github.com/tesla-local-control/tesla_ble_mqtt_docker) integration.

    ### Workflow

    1. **Trigger**: The automation is triggered in the morning and evening, at times specified by the user.
    2. **Action**:
       - The automation retrieves the selected charge plan.
       - Based on the charge plan, it calculates and sets the appropriate charge limit for the Tesla vehicle.
    3. **Notification**:
       - Users are notified of any changes in charge levels via their preferred device.

    ### Benefits

    - Enables the optimization of excess solar power during the day by adjusting the charge limit according to the chosen charge plan.
    - Maintains a minimum charge level so the battery does not stay depleted, rendering the car useless.
    - Provides users notifications to keep them informed about charge level changes.

          ```yaml
          input_select:
            tesla_charge_plan:
              options:

          <summary><code>Details</code></summary>
          You need [solar_optimizer](https://github.com/jmcollin78/solar_optimizer) for this selector to work.
          Select the switch <code>switch.enable_solar_optimizer_<tesla></code> declared in your configuration, for the car you selected.
          <strong>Do not select the switch that controls the solar charge: <code>switch.solar_optimizer_<tesla></code> (without <em>enable</em> in its name).</strong>

      description: >
        What is the level of charge to reach on offpeak plan?
        <details>
          <summary><code>Details</code></summary>
          The vehicle will charge up to this level during offpeak hours. If you have a car with LFP batteries, leave it to 100%.
          <strong>You have to schedule the charge with the Tesla app.</strong>
          ### Recommended battery charge limit
          - NCA or NMC: 80 to 90%
          - LFP: 100%

        <details>
          <summary><code>Details</code></summary>
          The vehicle will maintain this charge level, even when using solar optimization.
          If the selected charge plan is solar and the battery level falls below this level, the vehicle will recharge during nighttime.

          Charging will stop when this limit is reached while on solar plan.

        Publish an event to wake up the car.
        <details>
          <summary><code>Details</code></summary>
          This action is a workaround for some errors related to the current state of the Tesla integration. Sending a wake-up command via the button may sometimes generate an error, but the car usually wakes up fine after a few seconds.
          To address this, an event `WAKE_UP_TESLA_WITH_BUTTON` is published, which triggers an automation. While this automation may sometimes fail, it ultimately ensures the car wakes up.
          ### Automation code
          To make use of this option, you must create the following automation.
          ```yaml
          alias: Wake up car via event
          description: ""
          trigger:
            - platform: event
              event_type: WAKE_UP_TESLA_WITH_BUTTON
          condition: []
          action:
            - service: button.press
              continue_on_error: true
              target:
                entity_id: "{{ trigger.event.data.wake_up_button }}"
              enabled: true
          mode: parallel
          max: 2
          ```
        </details>
      selector:
        boolean: {}
      default: true
    send_notification:

      description: >

        <details>
          <summary><code>Details</code></summary>
          This will notify a user when the automation is triggered, with a summary of the current plan and charge limit.
